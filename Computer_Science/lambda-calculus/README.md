# Lambda Calculus

Lambda ($\lambda$) calculus, normally is used for computation based on function abstractions and application using variable binding and substitution.

Can be used to simulate any Turing Machine.

Lambda calculus consists in constuct lambda terms and perform reduction operation on them.

In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules.

1. $x$: A variable is a character or string representing a parameter.
