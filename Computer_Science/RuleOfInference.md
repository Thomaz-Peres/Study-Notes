A **rule of inference**, **inference rule** or **transformation rule** consist a function which takes premises, analyzers the syntax and return a conclusion.

Rule Of inference is purely syntactic and does not need to preserve any semantic property. usually only rules that are recursive are important.

## Standard from

In many areas (formar logic for example), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:

> Premise#1
   Premise#2
     ...
  Premise#n   
  Conclusion


$\displaystyle A\to B$
$\displaystyle {\underline {A\quad \quad \quad }}\,\!$
$\displaystyle B\!$
