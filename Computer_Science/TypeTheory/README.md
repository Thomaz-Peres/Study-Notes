The Type Theory is the study of [Type Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), Type Systems in resume is a area of study about types, with a set of rules, compilers, language design.

Some type theories serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation of mathematics.

One of them (and is popular the conjunction) is the `typed λ-calculus` or `Lambda Calculus` and `Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory.`. In the future I will se more about `lambda calculus`.

Notable early example of `type theory` is Church's [simply typed lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus) ($ \lambda ^{\to } $).

The type constructor ($ \to $) that builds function types. It is the cannonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.
