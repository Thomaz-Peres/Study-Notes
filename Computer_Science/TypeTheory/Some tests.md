| $\Gamma \vdash bool$  Type       | $bool$ is a type (under assumptions $\Gamma$).                                         |
| $\Gamma \vdash x : bool$         | $x$ is a term of type $bool$ (under assumptions $\Gamma$)                              |
| $\Gamma \vdash bool_1 = bool_2$  | Type $bool_1$ is equal to type $bool_2$ (under assumptions $\Gamma$)                   |
| $\Gamma \vdash x_1 = x_2 : bool$ | Terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ are both of type $T$ and are equal (under assumptions $\Gamma$). |
