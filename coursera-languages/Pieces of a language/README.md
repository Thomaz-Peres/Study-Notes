## Pieces of a Learning a Language

(this course focuses on semantics and idioms)

*In the final class of week 2*


Is this how we learning a programming language ?

Have 5 diffrerent terms of different things

- Syntax: How do you write language constructs ?
- Semantics: What do programs mean ? (Type checking rules and e valuation rules)
- Idioms: What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation ?
- Libraries: What facilites does the language (or a well-know project) provide "standart"? (E.g., file access, data structures, trees, list, hash tables)
- Tools: What do language implementations provide to make your job easier? (E.g., REPL, debugger, code formatter,...)
    - Not actually part of the language

These are 5 separete issues

    - In practice, all are essential for good programmers
    - Many people confuse them, but shouldn't


Explicando certas coisas:

3 - Semantics = is take the functions you have and make auxiliars functions, It is represent and recognizing typical patterns of use for certain features.
