# How ML Provides access to Datatype Values: Case Expressions

The better thing is a case expression. Here is a basic example for our example datatype binding

```sml
(* f has type MyType -> int *)
fun f x =
    case x of
        Pizza => 3
        | TwoInts(i1, i2) => i1 + i2
        | Str s => String.size s
```

In one sense, a case-expression is like a more powerful if-then-else expression.

Each branch has the form p => e where `p` is a `pattern` and `e` is an `expression`, and we separate the branches with the | character.
Patterns look like expressions, but do not think of them as expressions. Instead they are used to match against the result of evaluating the caseâ€™s first expression (the part after case). This is why evaluating a case-expression is called `pattern-matching`.

## Why are case-expressions better than functions for testing variants and extracting pieces?

- We can never "mess up" and try to extract something from the wrong variant. That is, we will not get exceptions like we get with __hd []__.
- If a case expressions forgets a variant, then the type-checker will give a warning message. This indicates that evaluating the case-expressions could find no matching branch, in which case it will raise an exception. If you have no such warnings, then you know thid does not occur.
- If a case expressions uses a variant twice, then the type-checker will give an error message since one of the branch could never possibly be used.
- If you still want functions like __null__ and __hd__, you can easily write them yourself (but do not do so for your homework).
- Pattern-matching is must more general and powerful than we have indicated so far. We give the "whole truth" about pattern-matching below.
