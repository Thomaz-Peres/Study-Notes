# By Name vs. By Position, Syntactic Sugar and The Truth About Tuples.

Records and tuples are very similar and they are bioth "each-of" type.

The only real difference is records are "by name" and tuples are "by positions"

Tuples is not more not less then records with particular field names.

This is the first of many examples we will see of syntactic sugar. We say, “tuples are just syntactic sugar
for records with fields named 1, 2, ..., n.”

- It is syntactic because we can describe everything about tuples in terms of equivalent record syntax.
- It is sugar because it makes the language sweeter


Syntactic sugar is a great way to keep the key ideas in a programming-language small (making it easier to implement) while giving programmers convenient ways to write things
