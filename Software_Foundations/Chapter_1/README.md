    - ```As an environment for developing formally certified software and hardware, Coq has been used, for example, to build CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C, and CertiKOS, a fully verified hypervisor, for proving the correctness of subtle algorithms involving floating point numbers, and as the basis for CertiCrypt, an environment for reasoning about the security of cryptographic algorithms. It is also being used to build verified implementations of the open-source RISC-V processor architecture```
