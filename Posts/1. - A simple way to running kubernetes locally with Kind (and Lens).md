This not a tutorial about kubernetes, kind or a API with .NET. It's just something help me to study somethings about kubernetes.

#### Prev tools need installed
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

#### A simple context about kind

It's a tool to run local kubernetes clusters with Docker container.
_____________________________________

First, let's create a simple API with .NET. (Really simple, I wont change anything).

Run in terminal:

	dotnet new webapi

Add the Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /app
ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=80
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet restore api1.csproj
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /app
ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=80
COPY --from=build /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "api1.dll"]
```

And run the docker command to create the image:

	docker build -t api:1.0 {Dockerfile local}

If you want to test the API:

	docker run --rm -it -p 8001:80 -e ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=80 api:1.0docker run --rm -it -p 8001:80 -e ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=80 api:1.0

And after:

	curl http://localhost:8001/weatherforecast
___

After API and the docker image created, let's create a Cluster with this yaml:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4

nodes:
- role: control-plane
```

After to create the yaml, run the command:

	kind create cluster --name api --config=Cluster/DeployCluster.yaml

If you want to check the Cluster, just run:

	kubectl cluster-info -context kind-api

After this steps, we need to add the app image in the cluster, with the command:

	kind load docker-image api:1.0 --name api

Now, let's working more with the kubernetes, and create the *Deployment* and the *Service* yamls:

Deployment.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
      version: v1
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: api:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Service.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
  - name: api
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

And after created the yamls files for the *Deployment* and *Service*, let's running the files:

	kubectl apply -f Deployment.yaml
And

	kubectl apply -f Service.yaml

You can check the services and deployments with `kubectl get deployments` and `kubectl get svc`.

Checking the **Services** you will see not have an **External-IP** what need to call the endpoints in our API (This not a kubernetes or a kind problem, is a docker problem, if you want a alternative solution, you can start from this [link](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1200#issuecomment-647145134)).

This command `port-forward` is used to connect your local computer to Docker bridge default gateway.

	sudo -E kubectl port-forward svc/api-service 8001:80

Now, you can run:

	curl http://localhost:8001/WeatherForecast

If you running the .NET api, the response will look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "date": "2024-03-08T23:14:25.6202397+00:00",
        "temperatureC": 28,
        "temperatureF": 82,
        "summary": "Hot"
    },
    {
        "date": "2024-03-09T23:14:25.6202432+00:00",
        "temperatureC": 26,
        "temperatureF": 78,
        "summary": "Scorching"
    },
    {
        "date": "2024-03-10T23:14:25.6202433+00:00",
        "temperatureC": 44,
        "temperatureF": 111,
        "summary": "Hot"
    },
    {
        "date": "2024-03-11T23:14:25.6202435+00:00",
        "temperatureC": 8,
        "temperatureF": 46,
        "summary": "Warm"
    },
    {
        "date": "2024-03-12T23:14:25.6202437+00:00",
        "temperatureC": -10,
        "temperatureF": 15,
        "summary": "Warm"
    }
]
```

With this, you have a cluster running locally.

## Lens

[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) it's a tool to managing and troubleshooting Kubernetes workloads and many other things.

Let's start installing Lens, and doing a login (you will need to create an account in lens and take the lens ID).

You can run in terminal  the command:

	k config view --output yaml

This command print your kubernetes configuration, we will need this to add in the Lens, or you can connect the kube folder or copy the kube config and paste too (normally the config was find in `$HOME/.kube/config`).

With this, you will have the Cluster connection, and you can see something like this and many other things
