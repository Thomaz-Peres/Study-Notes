## Concurrency and Parallelism

TODO: read more about.

In a system with a single processor, it is not possible to have
processes or threads truly executing at the same time. In this case,
the CPU is shared among running processes or threads using a process
scheduling algorithm that divides the CPU's time and yields the illusion
of parallel execution.
