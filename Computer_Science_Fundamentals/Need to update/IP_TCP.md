IP = computer address

## TCP

Is just a different set of convetions, that computers adhere to in order to solve a couple of different problems.

One is this problem of distinguishing one type of service from another.
The humans decided to assign different services that can be used on the internet. Unique numbers.
And so two of the most common are these (is numbers that a bunch of humans decided years ago will represent what you and I know as):

- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS

#### How TCP knows the another user got the message

That another computer by design of this protocol will also acknowledge the packets that he's received. And it will do it efficiently.

This another computer will send to your's computer a quick message saying "received all"
